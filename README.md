# myCODScraper

This will scrape any javascript file from my.callofduty.com / profile.callofduty.com in order to make the process of finding API routes easier.


# Why does this exist?

ATVI/COD like to move the routes used for their private API around different javascript files on each deployment. Running this scraper will hopefully make searching for routes easier for the end user. 

# Instructions

1. Install typescript globally
    ```console
    npm i -g typescript
    ```

2. Install local dependencies

    ```console
    npm i puppeteer @types/puppeteer
    ```

3. Create output folder with a javascript subfolder

4. Run the script with npm start.

5. All Done!
